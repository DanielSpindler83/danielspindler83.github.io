Hello, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer in a .NET development team. I really enjoy working across a broad area of the tech stack, and this blog is going to mostly be about the technologies I use day to day. 
Some of the main areas will include:
- All things Azure
- Azure DevOps
- Terraform
- Powershell
- My journey of learning .NET Core
- and lots more!

My main goal is to record my learning journey, document important concepts so that I understand them better and to try and help others.

Thanks for dropping by!
